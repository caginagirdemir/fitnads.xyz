# Omega-3 Fatty Acids

-  Omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods, such as fish and flaxseed, and in dietary supplements, such as fish oil.

-  The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is found mainly in plant oils such as flaxseed, soybean, and canola oils. DHA and EPA are found in fish and other seafood.

-  ALA is an essential fatty acid, meaning that your body can’t make it, so you must get it from the foods and beverages you consume. Your body can convert some ALA into EPA and then to DHA, but only in very small amounts. Therefore, getting EPA and DHA from foods (and dietary supplements if you take them) is the only practical way to increase levels of these omega-3 fatty acids in your body.

-  Phospholipid, Free Fatty Acids and Triglyceride Forms Should Be Preferred

### Omega-3 daily consumption

- If taken as a supplement, the total Omega-3 to be taken should have an EPA/DHA ratio of 3/2
- Daily intake should be around 15mg/kg for adults, and 20-40 percent more for those who train (depending on the intensity of training)
