# DEFINATION PERIOD

Definition is a fat burning process that we enter in order to show the muscles we have gained more clearly.

## A. Definition Diet

   Our main goal in the definition period is to burn fat. We should prepare our diet for this. The basis of burning fat is simple mathematics.

Calories are the energy unit found in almost all foods. There is an amount of energy that the body spends during the day (calories burned). At the same time, there is an amount of energy that we take into our body (calories taken in). In other words, if we consume less calories than we burn, we lose weight.

The body can lose this weight as water, fat and muscle. However, it is very difficult for athletes who follow a proper training program to lose muscle. Therefore, fat burning will occur. So how can we achieve this?

First, we need to find our daily calorie needs. In other words, the calories we need to consume every day to maintain our weight. Then, when we subtract 250-500 calories from this calorie, we will find the calories we need to burn fat.

### A1. Calculating Daily Calorie Needs

To find our daily calorie needs, we must first find our basal metabolic rate. Basal metabolic rate indicates the energy required for the body to maintain its vital functions at rest. When we add the calories we burn in our daily activities, we will have found our daily calorie needs.

There are several formulas and calculators to find our basal metabolic rate. You can use the calculators on our website to find your fat percentage and daily calorie needs.

### A2. Creating a Calorie Deficit

We have found our daily calorie needs. When we subtract a certain amount of calories from this value, this is called creating a calorie deficit. When we create a calorie deficit, we lose weight and burn fat. So how many calories should we remove?

A 250-500 calorie deficit will both provide good results and prevent muscle loss as much as possible. For example, an individual with a daily calorie need of 2800 can start definition with 2300 calories.

We need to be a little careful here. We need to eat with a minimum calorie deficit that will allow us to burn fat. An excessive calorie deficit means loss of performance and muscle loss in training. This means that metabolism slows down and burning fat becomes more difficult in the long term. In other words, we should not always eat less to lose weight, we should be patient.

### A3. Macronutrients

We have calculated the calories. It is time to adjust the macronutrients. Macronutrients are protein, fat and carbohydrates. Macronutrients make up calories. So how do we adjust these macronutrients? Let's start with protein.

#### A3.1 Protein

We must make sure that we are taking in the minimum protein required to prevent muscle loss. 1 g of protein per kg is enough for a sedentary (inactive) individual not to experience protein deficiency. However, these needs increase in sports nutrition because we damage our muscles more. Therefore, we need more nutrients for their renewal. 2.5 g of protein per lean mass (kg) of the athlete will be sufficient for muscle renewal.

If we consume more protein than necessary, there will not be enough calories for fat and carbohydrates, which are also important macronutrients. At the same time, protein also has calories and too much of it will make it harder for you to lose weight.

#### A3.2 Fat

Fat has more calories than protein and carbohydrates. Therefore, if we take too much, it will fill our calories. However, fat is absolutely very important. It is important for joint health, body resistance, immune system and fat metabolism. In other words, we should also take fat to burn fat. The recommended amount of fat per kg is 1gr per lean mass.

#### A3.3 Carbohydrate

Carbohydrate is our main energy source. Although carbohydrate is important for our performance, it comes after protein and fat in importance. After deciding on the required protein and fat calories, we complete the remaining calories with carbohydrates. Reducing carbohydrates during the definition period will be useful for us. As carbohydrates decrease, fat and protein may increase.  
  
### A4. Which Foods Should We Consume?

As long as we eat in accordance with our macros, we can lose weight and burn fat. However, regulating our food choices has a great effect on our health. We can also reach our macros with fast food sources, but this can damage our digestive and excretory systems in the long run. At the same time, it is very difficult to get enough micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) this way. Micronutrients also play important roles in metabolism, and therefore in fat burning.

#### A4.1 Protein sources

Animal sources are good sources because they contain essential amino acids. We can meet most of our protein needs from meat, fish and dairy products.

Plant-based foods also contain protein, and we should add them to our daily protein needs. The amino acid profiles of plant-based sources are weaker than animal-based foods. However, we can get the necessary amino acids by combining legumes with grains. Dried beans and rice pilaf are examples of this. With such practices, you can also get the necessary protein as a vegetarian or vegan.

#### A4.2 Fat sources

 The best sources we can consume as fat sources are olive oil, avocado, fish with high omega-3 content (like salmon…), nuts with low carbohydrate content (like almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts, walnuts…) and coconut oil. These oils are good for heart diseases and also have a positive effect on our metabolism. Therefore, they support us in burning fat.

In addition to these, small amounts of butter and sunflower oil can be consumed as long as we adapt them to our macros. However, if we want to see the best results, we should be careful to get most of our fat needs from healthy fats.

#### A4.3 Carbohydrate sources

Foods that increase our blood sugar cause our insulin hormone to increase. When the insulin hormone increases, the body stores more fat. Although it may sound scary when put this way, the truth is not that scary. As long as you adjust the calorie deficit and lose weight, you will burn fat. However, we can accelerate fat burning with the right carbohydrate choices. We can also reduce our chances of becoming diabetic in the future.

The best foods we can consume for this are foods with a low glycemic index that are digested more slowly. Bulgur, whole wheat bread, brown rice, oats, wheat germ are good examples of such sources.

High glycemic index sources such as white rice and potatoes can also be consumed. If we want to get the same benefit while consuming these, we can use small portions by taking their glycemic load into account.  
  
### A5. Training During the Defining Period

Even if our goal is to burn fat, build muscle or just for general health, it is very important to have a heavy and solid training regime that will allow us to get stronger.

We should try to maintain our strength in our training programs and, if possible, to get stronger. Maintaining our strength will prevent us from losing muscle.

During the defining period, we should generally try to continue to work heavily in weight training as in the bulking period. Because we protect our muscles by working heavily just as we develop them by working heavily.

Lowering the weights is not a logical choice since we are in definition. Depending on how low our calories are in definition and how much weight we lose, our weights may decrease to a certain extent, but our goal is to minimize this as much as possible. Since we do not consume enough calories, we may not be able to recover well enough from our training. Therefore, it may be logical to reduce the volume (work volume) for weight training.

For example, an athlete who does 5 repetitions of squats with 120 kg may do 4 repetitions with 120 kg during the defining period because he has difficulty due to low calories. You can reduce the work volume in this way.

### A6. Supplement Use During the Defination Period

Fat burning supplements can support us during the definition period. However, if our diet is not adjusted correctly, fat burners will not be of use to us. First of all, we should regulate our diet. Fat burners are only support products.

In addition, as the carbohydrates we take in during the definition period decrease, it will be difficult to comply with our vitamin and mineral requirements. At this point, we can support our diet with nutritional supplements. We can have a blood test to find out which vitamin and/or mineral supplement we should use.

### A7. I'm New to Sports, Should I Do Defination?

Defination is applied to make the muscle mass look more clear and aesthetic. If we have not developed a good muscle mass before, simply reducing our fat rate will not allow us to achieve this goal.

If our fat rate is too high, we can of course do definition because this will have a negative effect on our health. However, if our fat rate is not too high, getting stronger and building muscle without restricting our calories will be more useful for us in the long run.

So what can we do if our fat rate is high and our muscle mass is low? This situation is also called “skinny fat”. In this case, if we define to burn fat, we risk our little muscle mass. If we bulk to build muscle, we gain more fat. The best solution is not to create a calorie deficit or surplus.

After making the calculations, we should only take in the calories we need. When we take in the calories we need, we can renew and strengthen after training. Therefore, there will be muscle development. In this way, the fat rate does not increase and even fat can be burned.
