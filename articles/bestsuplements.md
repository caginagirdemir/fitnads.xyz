# WHAT IS A SUPPLEMENT? THE BEST SUPPLEMENTS!

Achieving the body we want is the result of conscious training, quality nutrition, disciplined rest and the right mentality; in short, a balanced life. A factor that disrupts the balance, no matter how small, will prevent us from reaching the results we want. The purpose of supplements is to reduce the obstacles on the way.

Supplements are the last part of our nutrition in order of importance. First, we must establish our calories, macros such as protein, our fluid intake, what to eat and when. In this case, supplements support us. Supplements can also cover the deficiencies at the bottom of the pyramid. However, supplements alone are not the whole pyramid!

# What is a Supplement? What Does It Do?

Supplement means sports nutrition. It means food specially prepared for athletes.

These are called supplements because these products do not contain all the vitamins, minerals and sufficient nutrients you need to survive on their own. That's why they are not used instead of meals. Supplements are there to fill the gaps.

That's why it's important to understand the missing nutrient first.

## Before starting the supplement reviews, I would like to emphasize 2 misconceptions about this subject:

#### -  Supplements are not harmful!

These products are foods. The more harmful the food, the more harmful the supplement can be.

Supplements are processed foods; but if you do not produce your own food, it is a bit funny to look at supplements as bad food. In fact, no matter how well you eat, some foods may be missing from your diet. The purpose of supplements is to fill these gaps.

#### -  Supplements are not miracles!

Supplements are sports nutrition. The more beneficial the food, the more beneficial the supplement can be.

Supplements provide ease of use because they are presented in isolation only for the foods we need. They have their place and time. But they do not create incredible differences. Using these products without training and eating properly is like putting on a bow tie without wearing a suit.

Remember! The best supplement is training, doing sports, eating well!



# The Best Supplements!

### -  1: Creatine!

Creatine plays a role in energy use for those who do strength-based sports such as weight training, sprinting, and wrestling.

According to research, creatine is the only supplement that will increase performance for athletes with low tempo and high intensity.

Since it directly affects your strength, it can help you work with higher weights, and indirectly supports muscle development and mass increase.

### -  2: ZMA (Zinc and Magnesium)

Zinc and magnesium… Minerals that play a primary role in many activities of metabolism. Some of the problems that occur when they are deficient: Low sexual desire, hair loss, white spots on nails, low testosterone and acne… Supporting them with supplements naturally increases your testosterone (pulls it down to where it should be) and increases the efficiency you get from your sleep. Indirectly, it helps your work in the gym and kitchen to work.

### -  3: Omega-3 Fish Oil!

The omega-6 ratio in our diet is usually much higher than the omega-3 ratio. Especially in those who do sports and consume animal products, the omega-3 ratio is very low. This opens the door to many problems. If you are thinking about your health in the long term and want to speed up your recovery from training, omega-3 is a must.

### -  4: Probiotic Supplements!

You have trained, you care about your sleep, you are eating. But are you sure that the food you eat is going where it should go?

Bacteria do this for us. However, when we include antibiotics, processed foods, stress and grains in our lives, these bacteria cannot do their job, and our efforts are wasted. We definitely recommend it, especially if you have an irregular gut!

More than 200 studies say that more than 170 diseases are due to deficient probiotics. Irritable bowel (IBS), weak immune system, inflammations, eczema, skin problems, bad breath, diarrhea or constipation... Probiotics are very important for us to overcome these problems.

Probiotics are active bacteria, you need to take them alive. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are foods that feed the bacteria that already exist. Prebiotics are not affected by heat or humidity. Both forms meet the need.

The number of bacteria is an important indicator for a good probiotic supplement, but the variety of bacteria is more important than the amount.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus acidophilus are especially important bacteria. This product is a rich mixture containing them, so we can easily recommend it.

When buying probiotic supplements, you should pay attention to their expiration dates. You can't understand whether the bacteria are still alive and effective in any other way.

### -  5: BCAA (Amino Acid)

Those who take their protein needs regularly during the day do not have to supplement. However, if you want to get the most out of your workout and want to renew as soon as possible, the product you will buy will be BCAA. If you are training in an empty stomach with intermittent fasting - which is one of the most popular methods of building lean muscle mass - BCAA is very important during training.

Also, if you are not doing weight training but doing long-paced sports such as running, swimming or cycling, BCAA will also increase your performance. When it comes to performance and muscle development, the most important amino acids are these branched-chain amino acids.

A good BCAA supplement contains at least twice the amino acid leucine. You can also prefer complex versions that contain caffeine before training.

### -  6: Protein Powder! ( OPTIONAL )

You may be wondering, why is the most popular supplement among athletes not included on the list?

Let's explain, protein powder may be at the top of the list for some. If you can't meet your daily protein needs, if it's not possible to do this with your diet, whey protein, which is a practical method, is a must for muscle development! Protein is essential for muscle development, there's not much to say

But if you meet your protein needs, you don't need to take it. That's why we couldn't say "it should definitely be on the list".

The greatest need for protein powder is during the diet period. Because it's easy to take protein while consuming high calories, and our bodies are not catabolic anyway. However, when trying to lose weight, you will probably need to take supplements in a low-calorie diet, or it will be very useful.
