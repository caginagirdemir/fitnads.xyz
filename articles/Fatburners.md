## A1. What Do Fat Burners Do?

Fat burner is a general name here, its components also vary from product to product. For example, fat burning can be supported for many reasons such as:

Accelerating metabolism - allowing us to burn more calories during the day.

Reducing appetite - feeling fuller, reducing involuntary calorie intake

Transporting fatty acids - ensuring that they are used more effectively for energy.

The purpose of fat burning supplement products is to burn fat and lose weight. But as you can see, not all of them work the same way. Now let's examine the best fat burning products one by one and see what the most commonly used L Carnitine or Carnitine is, what is CLA.

Let's not forget, the best fat burner is training! If you don't train, it will not be possible for you to see the big effect of these supplements!

### A1.1 Thermogenic Fat Burning Supplements

Thermogenic fat burning supplements can help us burn more calories by accelerating metabolism. In this way, fat burning occurs. They increase basal metabolism, that is, the calories burned at rest.

The metabolism accelerating effect does not mean that you will burn kilos of fat directly from where you sit. Let's not think of these products as a magic wand. To give an example from life, even a 200-calorie difference can be considered a very big difference. If we burn 200 calories more every day, it will be a 2800-calorie deficit in 2 weeks. However, we can cover this difference with a small chocolate every day and we may not be able to burn fat. First of all, we need to regulate our diet.

However, over time, thermogenic fat burner, metabolism acceleration and regular training will undoubtedly contribute to you.

#### Caffeine, The Best Thermogenic Fat Burner

Caffeine, as we know it, is the most efficient, in fact the most widely used thermogenic fat burner in metabolism acceleration and fat burning. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea and a small amount of cocoa. It is one of the best fat burners.

Caffeine accelerates basal metabolism. Therefore, it allows us to burn more calories and more fat. In studies conducted, when used with regular exercise and a diet aimed at weight loss, caffeine has helped in losing weight, burning fat and maintaining weight.

Caffeine increases the level of epinephrine (adrenaline) hormone in the blood. Adrenaline is transported from the blood to fat cells and sends a signal for the destruction of fat cells. Caffeine thus supports fat burning.

At the same time, caffeine use has the feature of suppressing appetite and increasing the feeling of satiety. In this way, it can increase the applicability of the diet and provide easier and faster weight loss and fat burning.

Studies have shown that for every mg of caffeine taken, approximately 0.1 calories are burned in 24 hours. In other words, 20 calories more can be burned per day with 200 mg of caffeine intake.

### A1.2 CLA

CLA accelerates metabolism and suppresses appetite.

CLA is a supplement that strengthens immunity and helps heart health. In theory, it prevents fat storage and stimulates fat breakdown. However, we cannot say that it is very effective in burning fat directly, it is indirectly effective. The effect of CLA is lower in young individuals. Its effect increases with age.

While some studies show that it is effective in burning fat in obese and overweight individuals, other studies show the opposite in the general population, that is, it does not have a significant fat burning effect.

We can say that it has been found to be more effective in overweight or obese and elderly individuals.  
  
### A1.3 Cortisol Blocker Fat Burning Supplements

#### What is L-Carnitine or Carnitine?

Carnitine is an amino acid derivative used for weight loss. It carries stored, triple-bonded fatty acids to the mitochondria, allowing the breakdown of fatty acids and their conversion into energy. Mitochondria undertake the task of converting fuel into energy in our cells. Carnitine also strengthens the nervous system and brain.

But the effect of L Carnitine on fat burning is somewhat controversial. In an 8-week study, it was found that regular L-carnitine use did not support fat burning in women who exercised 4 days a week.

In a large meta-analysis conducted on obese and elderly individuals, it was seen that L-Carnitine use provided significantly more weight loss and fat burning.

While some people and studies find it efficient, according to some studies, it is ineffective in fat burning. We can say that it is more efficient for those who cannot get enough animal protein, obese or overweight individuals and elderly individuals. If you are not following a diet that is completely focused on burning fat, it will most likely not work.

## A.2. Are Fat Burning Supplements Harmful to Health?

Fat burning ingredients can be even riskier when compared to other supplements. Taking them in high doses can cause dizziness, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Other than that, when used in a healthy and balanced way while doing sports, there is not much to worry about for the fat burners we have reviewed.

Nevertheless, we recommend that you consult your doctor before using any supplement.

## A3. How to use Fat Burning Supplements?

Its use may vary from product to product. For this, it is necessary to determine the use according to the product. First of all, make sure that you are buying a product that has been inspected and approved. Do not buy products that you do not know for the purpose of burning fat. Remember, there is no safe supplement that will make you burn kilos of fat just because you use it every day. It can help to a certain extent with nutrition and training.

Make sure that you read the usage section of the product you buy well. You need to know that it is not logical to take too much.

In addition, in order to burn fat, you need to be in a calorie deficit. In other words, you need to burn more calories than you take in. For this, you should regulate your diet and track your calories. You can get the necessary information by reviewing our fitness nutrition article. Afterwards, you can move on to the definition guide and learn how to follow the best fat burning diet. Otherwise, even the best fat burning supplement will not be able to help you lose weight and burn fat on its own.

Again, without forgetting, the best fat burner is exercise, the best thermogenic, the best appetite regulator, and the best metabolism accelerator is exercise!
