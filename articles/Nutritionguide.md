# Fitness Nutrition Guide: Everything About Athlete Nutrition!

You will learn everything you need to know just by reading this guide,

If you are new to sports, “I have too much fat” or “I am too thin, where should I start?” this guide is for you!

Experienced athletes: we make your life easier! You will save yourself from a huge loss of time, money and enthusiasm!

I must say in advance: It is impossible to constantly apply stereotypical fitness nutrition programs such as “These will be eaten in the morning, at noon and at night”.

No athlete diet works this way! Because no one has the willpower and opportunity to continue such diets for more than 3 days. Real life is not like the program on paper.

So what should we do?

The important thing is to be able to organize the calories and macros we need in our diet, mathematics is infallible!

## Athlete Nutrition: Nutrition Pyramid

(picture here)

Calories: The energy unit of nutrients. We all have a certain amount of energy we need according to our body size and activity level. We need to calculate this and pay attention to calories while creating an athlete diet. It is located at the base of the pyramid because it is the most important factor of the nutrition program we will prepare.

Macros: They are the building blocks of the nutrients we eat. We will examine carbohydrates, proteins and fats here. We should learn their ratios, how much we need to take according to our purpose and pay attention to this.

Micros: They are organic or inorganic components that we take with food but usually express in milligrams or smaller units, not in grams like macros. We should understand vitamins and minerals, nutritional quality and our water needs and shape our diet accordingly.

In the nutrition timing section, we will examine how many meals we need to eat according to our purpose, the hours of the day and how we should eat before and after sports.

Finally, supplements are foods that will support the nutrition program in order to complete the deficiencies and increase our performance.

## What You Need to Know About Muscle Building and Fat Burning

If you are looking for a bodybuilding nutrition program, you may have two goals: muscle building or fat burning!

Fat and muscle are different tissues. We cannot gain or lose either of them easily.

These activities require a process. Are you curious about this process? If not, you should, because this is important!

Because this is the first most important thing to understand for a fitness nutrition program!

You neither gain nor lose muscle nor fat easily.

In order to lose weight and fat, and to build muscle, we must follow our nutrition program patiently. We must know how to make adjustments if it does not go as we want.

### 1.Calories: The Foundation of Athlete Nutrition!

We said that the most important factor for athlete nutrition is to find the calories we need.

#### -  Nutrition for fat burning
You should take about 15% less than your daily needs. Our calculator automatically calculates this for you.

#### -  Nutrition for muscle growth
You should go up by about 10% of your daily needs.

If you have not seen any results despite sticking to the plan within 2 weeks, you can go up by 10% (muscle building) or down by 10% (fat burning) depending on your goal.

You should also consider the other factors in the rest of this guide, your training routine and your stress levels. These are what the guide can theoretically offer you and most of the time you will reach your goal this way.

### 2.Macros: How Much Protein, Fat and Carbohydrate Should We Take?

We found our calories to prepare a fitness nutrition program. Now let's look at how much protein, fat and carbohydrate we should take in order.

#### -  Athlete Diet Protein Need

Protein is important for the renewal and growth of our muscles after training. That's why whenever we say athlete nutrition, protein comes up :slight_smile:

1 gram of protein provides 4 kcal of energy.

It is also important in our diet because it is the most satiating and thermic macro protein, but overdoing it and consuming too much protein may seem expensive to us due to several different perspectives.

Those whose aim is to burn fat have higher protein needs because they create a calorie deficit. Because when we eat with excess calories, our body does not disturb its comfort anyway, but when we eat less calories, the value of protein increases even more because the body will become catabolic.

#### -  Athlete Nutrition Fat Need

Fats are very important for our healthy life. They provide 9 kcal of energy per gram. Since they contain high calories, those who want to burn fat can avoid excessive consumption, while those who want to build muscle can prefer them.

Especially if we want to gain weight or if we are an experienced athlete and want to increase calories for the bulking period, we can consume more fat.

Regardless of our goal, we should consume at least 1 gram of fat for every kilogram of our lean body mass.

This is important for our body to continue to function healthily.

Are fats harmful? Do they make us fat?

Our body's fattening generally occurs due to excess energy intake. We cannot directly say that a food "makes us gain weight".

However, since fats contain high energy (9 kcal per gram), they can cause weight gain. In general, not exceeding 1 gram of fat consumption per kilogram is a good target for those who do not want to gain too much weight.

#### -  Carbohydrate Needs in Athlete Nutrition

Carbohydrates are not indispensable macros for our body like proteins and fats; but they are especially important for people who do sports to meet our energy needs, fill glycogen stores and for some hormones.

They provide 4 kcal of energy per gram.

Low carbohydrates will generally be suitable for those who want to burn fat, and high carbohydrates will be suitable for those who want to build muscle.

However, we cannot say that an extremely low carbohydrate diet is very efficient for athletes. After taking our daily protein and fat needs, we can meet the remaining calorie needs from carbohydrate sources.

Do carbohydrates make you gain weight?

Our body generally gains fat due to excess energy intake. We cannot directly say that a food “makes you gain weight”.

However, carbohydrates are usually suitable for overeating, research shows that we actually eat more than we think.

In addition, the insulin response of carbohydrates is usually high, that is, they reduce fat burning and increase fat storage. Therefore, in order not to gain fat, we should reduce carbohydrates with high glycemic index values ​​or processed carbohydrates; we should generally control the amount.


### 3.Micros, Nutritional Quality and Water

But of course, it does not end there. Carbohydrate is carbohydrate, but it has nutritional quality. Is every protein the same? So what do we do with water?

Counting calories can help us increase our muscle mass and burn fat, but nutrition is not just about macros and calories. We need to give great importance to this part, especially for healthy nutrition, but since this guide is a summary, we will examine this part in a few items.

Water is important for health, as well as fat burning and performance. We should make sure we pee 5 clean pee every day. We should check our urine color. You can also check our article on the importance of water in sports.

### 4.Timing: When and What Should We Eat?

Compared to those lower down the pyramid, food timing is not that important; however, when other factors are right, there are things we can gain from this.

#### -  How many meals should be consumed?

Despite repeated research, the number of meals does not make any significant difference according to the findings. In this regard, acting with the principle of “The best diet is the one that can be applied” seems to be the smartest option.

As long as you take in calories, macros and micros; if you like 3 meals, consume 3 meals, if you like 6 meals, consume 6 meals, if you like 1 meal, consume 1 meal.

A few issues here can generally benefit us:

First of all, it makes more sense to divide macros into meals. In other words, instead of taking all carbohydrates in one meal and fats in one meal; it makes more sense to consume all of them in every meal.

It makes more sense to spread protein intake throughout the day, especially as muscle mass increases. In other words, instead of taking all proteins in 1 meal; take care to take proteins in the morning, at noon and in the evening.

#### -  Nutrition Before and After Exercise

What you consume before and after exercise may vary depending on the type of your diet. Especially if you are training for a long time (more than 90 minutes), a meal rich in carbohydrates at least 1 hour before exercise may be beneficial. After exercise, a meal with carbohydrates and protein will be beneficial.

It may be a logical approach to save the biggest meal of the day for after exercise.

If you are doing Intermittent Fasting, it may be beneficial to take BCAA during exercise. After exercise, you should consume a meal with carbohydrates and protein. Apart from that, you can get your calories in the amount of meals you want during the eating period.

#### -  Do you eat at night?

You eat at night. It is a complete myth that it makes you fat. It is not a logical approach to stop eating after a certain hour in order not to gain weight. Moreover, evening hours are actually the most suitable hours for eating.

We can express an optimum evening plan as follows: you should sleep before midnight, and eat a meal according to your daily needs 1.5 - 2 hours before going to bed.

### 5.Supplements

As we learned from the pyramid, supplements are the last foods we should worry about in a nutrition program. Because we can get almost all of them from foods anyway.

Some are completely unimportant, some are important or even essential depending on their place.

# SUMMARY: What are the rules for Athlete Nutrition?

-  We need to learn our daily calorie, protein, fat and carbohydrate needs. We should follow these regularly for at least 30 days.

-  Minimally processed, organic, whole foods should make up the majority of the foods we eat. If fast food and supplements make up the majority, it will be difficult to reach the aesthetic and athletic goals we want, but not impossible. Because healthy nutrition and fitness nutrition are not the same, they are just parallel.

-  We need to pee clean 5 times a day. We should control the water we drink accordingly. We should control the color of our urine.

-  We should consume a variety of vegetables or fruits every day. Nutrition is not just about protein and calories. The same thing is not eaten every day.

-  When we eat food and how many meals we eat generally doesn't matter much, but being regular maximizes its benefits. For sports nutrition, the post-workout meal is the most important meal, not breakfast.

-  We should focus on a better diet every day, not the best diet. In this way, instead of stressful, painful and temporary results; habits that will make us aesthetic, athletic and healthy throughout our lives will be established.

We have come to the end of our pyramid, and therefore our guide. With this guide, you have understood how to create your own nutrition program.
