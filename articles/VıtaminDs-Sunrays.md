# A review on the subject of Vitamin D - Sun rays

-  Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin by the effect of ultraviolet (UV) rays coming from the sun. UVA and UVB are important for us.

-  The effects of UVA and UVB on vitamin D synthesis are opposite to each other. UVB synthesizes vitamin D. UVA, on the contrary, disrupts vitamin D synthesis and also long-term exposure to UVA causes DNA damage and skin cancer, increasing the risk of skin cancer.

-  We are exposed to UVB more at noon (necessary for vitamin D synthesis)

-  We are exposed to UVA more at times other than noon. (Excessive exposure increases the risk of skin cancer)

-  According to some scientists' research, vitamin D synthesis in the body of someone who sunbathes for 30 minutes at noon can increase up to 50,000 IU/day. And this is the amount of vitamin D we need for 1 month.

-  And it should not be forgotten that when properly sunbathed, Vitamin D synthesized in the skin is absorbed from the skin within 24-48 hours and passes into the blood. If vitamin D is washed away from the body with shampoo or soap before it is absorbed from the skin, there will be no synthesis of vitamin D.

-  I would like to touch on one last additional issue and leaving it to people to do their own research. Unfortunately, sunscreens block UVB rays, which are responsible for vitamin D synthesis. On the other hand, sunscreens do not prevent UVA from passing into the skin. In other words, UVA causes skin cancer, while UVB has the effect of synthesizing vitamin D. Unfortunately, sunscreens pass UVA and block UVB.

# As a result, if you want to obtain vitamin D in the most efficient and harmless way with sun rays, you should do this by sunbathing for 30 minutes once a month when the sun is at its highest in your location.
